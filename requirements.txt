 
# These requirements are for the Python that is run in the
# backend/agents container.  As of 03/20/2024, this 
# container needs far fewer dependencies than most others,
# so these requirements are down at the service-code level.
#
# Requirements for tests, code style and other build stuff reside in
# requirements-build.txt

# Do the source-available stuff first to fast-fail if credentials are not right
# DEF 07/26/2022: Due to bug in codefresh private repo plugin, this leaf-common
# comes in from top-level requirements.txt file for now.
