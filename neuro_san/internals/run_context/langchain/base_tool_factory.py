class BaseToolFactory:
    """
    A factory class for creating instances of various prebuilt tools.

    This class provides an interface to instantiate different tools based on the specified `base_tool`.
    The available tools include web search utilities and HTTP request utilities. This approach standardizes
    tool creation and simplifies integration with agents requiring predefined tools.

    ### Supported Tools:
    - **Search Tools:**
        - `bing_search`: Returns a `BingSearchResults` instance for performing Bing search queries.
        - `tavily_search`: Returns a `TavilySearchResults` instance for performing Tavily search queries.

    - **HTTP Request Tools:** These allow making different types of HTTP requests using the `RequestsToolkit`
      with a `TextRequestsWrapper`. The following tool names are available:
        - `requests_get`: For making GET requests.
        - `requests_post`: For making POST requests.
        - `requests_patch`: For making PATCH requests.
        - `requests_put`: For making PUT requests.
        - `requests_delete`: For making DELETE requests.

    ### Arguments:
    - `base_tool` (str): The name of the tool to instantiate. It determines which tool will be created.
    - `args` (Dict): A dictionary of keyword arguments passed to the tool's constructor.
                     The accepted arguments depend on the tool being instantiated. Some common ones include:
        - **Search Tools:**
          - `num_results` (int): Number of results to return (for Bing search).
          - `max_results` (int): Maximum number of results (for Tavily search).
        - **HTTP Request Tools:**
          - `headers` (Dict[str, str], optional): HTTP headers to include in the request.
          - `aiosession` (ClientSession, optional): Async session for making requests.
          - `auth` (Any, optional): Authentication credentials if required.
          - `response_content_type` (Literal["text", "json"], default="text"): Expected response format.

    ### Extending the Class

        To integrate additional tools, add a tool configuration file in JSON or HOCON format
        and set its path to the environment variable `BASE_TOOL_INFO_FILE`.

        The configuration should follow this structure:
        - The tool name serves as a key.
        - The corresponding value should be a dictionary with:
        - `class`: The fully qualified class name of the tool.
        - `args`: A dictionary of arguments required for the tool's initialization,
            which may include nested class configurations.

        The default prebuilt tool config file can be seen at
        'neuro_san/internals/run_context/langchain/base_tool_info.hocon'

    **Note:**
    Future updates will introduce support for integrating custom `CodedTool`
    implementations and Langchainâ€™s `BaseToolKit` into this factory.
